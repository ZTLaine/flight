<h2>Flight</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players play as a dragon who returned to her den to find her hatchling missing, and must figure out where its gone and bring it back.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have fun controlling the flight of the dragon and searching for a hatchling.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A side-scrolling explorer game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls the dragon using the left and right keys for direction, and the up key to flap their wings and take flight.  Was hoping to be able to have an aeriel combat mechanic allowing you to shoot fireballs while in the air.
Was also intending to have a mechanic which limited your flight in some manner due to emotional distress affecting physical function, but could not think of a good way to implement it without the game becoming frustrating.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Experimentation with manual flapping in a less stressful way than flappy birds.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It's gameplay in general is fairly unusual, especially combined with the fatigue mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in a generic fantasy world at this point which has dragons in it.  Not terribly unique, but instead of the common  perspective where one plays as a human facing a dragon, in this game you play as a dragon facing either a human or another dragon.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The dragon you play as is a mother, unsure of whether her brood has wandered off, been kidnapped, or possibly worse.  The tension she feels is meant too have some sort of effect on her stamina, but was not implemented yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who enjoys dragons and would enjoy something akin to a dragon-sim (which is what this was meant to be a base prototype for).  
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As it currently stands, this should probably take only a minute or two.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies in the current version involve getting into the air and flying around to try and find the hatchling.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Background made using: http://jbjdesigns.deviantart.com/art/Forest-Background-340054347
Dragon made using: http://spritedatabase.net/file/13852
Music from: http://opengameart.org/content/death-is-just-another-path
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Was attempting to make this one without looking at any tutorials, but if there is one similar to flappy bird, that would probably be most similar.
