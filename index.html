<h2>Flight</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players play as a dragon who returned to her den to find her hatchling missing, and must figure out where its gone.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have fun controlling the flight of the dragon and searching for the hatchling.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A side-scrolling explorer game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls the dragon using the left and right keys for direction, and the space key to flap their wings and take flight.  Was hoping to be able to have an aeriel combat mechanic allowing you to shoot fireballs while in the air.
You move significantly faster in the air, and can build up to a maximum speed.
Was also intending to have you die if you hit the ground at too high a velocity, but it hasn't been added yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Experimentation with manual flapping in a less stressful way than flappy birds.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I don't know any games where you just get to fly around like this, though I'm sure some do exist.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in a generic fantasy world at this point which has dragons in it.  Not terribly unique, but instead of the common  perspective where one plays as a human facing a dragon, in this game you play as a dragon facing either a human or another dragon.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The dragon you play as is a mother, unsure of whether her brood has wandered off, been kidnapped, or possibly worse.  The tension she feels is meant too have some sort of effect on her stamina, but was not implemented yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who enjoys dragons and would enjoy something akin to a dragon-sim (which is what this was meant to be a base prototype for).  
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As it currently stands, this should probably take only a minute or two.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies in the current version involve getting into the air and flying around to try and find the hatchling.
