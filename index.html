<h2>Recollection</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players travel with the main character, Cassie as she begins to discover the cause of her time and memory loss -- Dissociative Identity Disorder.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have fun solving puzzle games with an increasing variety of mechanics as Cassie meets and learns to work with the other people inside her, as well as giving players a non-sensationalized or stigmatazied view of a rare mental illness.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A side scrolling platformer utilizing puzzles and collection elements to facillitate a narrative.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player is able to jump and move using arrow keys, and gains the ability to reverse gravity using Space.  Currently this ability is given at the outset, however it should actually be recieved after speaking to the first member of her system and showing him 3 memories that she's collected.A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Experimentation with upside-down gameplay and whether it can be properly utizlized without making the puzzles too easy.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The narrative is unique as far as I know, as is taking a more realistic view of living with mental illness and coping mechanisms.  
The gravity feature is also pretty unique.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting for the game is reality, in a broad sense -- no special world or storyline except Cassie's own life and mind.  
The uniqueness of the world comes from her experiences of trying to navigate the world while living with the symptoms of her DID.
Full game would take place in both reality and her "In-World" -- the world the others inside her have constructed for them to spend time in.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In reality strange happenings (misplaced items, gaining awareness in situations/places she has no idea how she got into, etc) culminate in her finding a note left for her on her dresser giving her instructions on how to reach her In-World.  
Not knowing who it is from or how it got there, she follows the instructions hoping to find the answer to the lost time and other problems plagueing her.  This is when she enters the In-World and meets the first of the others living inside her, Jason.
(This is the section of the game that this prototype is showing.)
In her "In-world", the characters she interacts with are distinct people with their own wants and interests and personalities, who have to share her body with her.
As the game would continue she would meet all the people in her system (All the people sharing her body) and continue navigating through her subconcious and the In-World to solve conflicts between members and increase the group's overall effectiveness to allow her to better function in reality.
Each member has their own abilities concerning the In-World, for example, Jason's is the ability to reverse gravity.
Throughout this, if she's in the In-World, someone else has to be controlling her body -- whoever is doing so takes their abilities with them, removing them from her current toolbox.  More than one person can be missing at a time, leading to an interesting combination of abilities that change over time, forcing the player to innovate continue sucessfuly solving the puzzles and making progress.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who enjoys puzzle solving and narratives.  
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This section, once completed, should take about 5 minutes to complete.  The whole imagined game would ideally take about an hour or two.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies will involve exploration and testing the various abilities in all the areas, even when it doesn't necessarily seem obvious to use it there.
In this section, lots of jumping.
